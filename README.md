## ⚒️ Resume Builder

ResumeStudio's resume builder allows you to create a modern professional resume easily.

It has 5 Core Features:
| <div style="width:285px">**Feature**</div> | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **1. Real Time UI Update** | The resume PDF is updated in real time as you enter your resume information, so you can easily see the final output. |
| **2. Modern Professional Resume Design** | The resume PDF is a modern professional design that adheres to U.S. best practices and is ATS friendly to top ATS platforms such as Greenhouse and Lever. It automatically formats fonts, sizes, margins, bullet points to ensure consistency and avoid human errors. |
| **3. Privacy Focus** | The app runs locally on your browser, meaning no sign up is required and no data ever leaves your browser, giving you complete peace of mind about your personal data. |
| **4. Import From Existing Resume PDF** | If you already have an existing resume PDF, you have the option to import it directly, so you can update your resume design to a modern professional design in literally a few seconds. |
| **5. Proven Track Record** | ResumeStudio users have landed interviews and offers from top companies, such as Dropbox, Google, Meta to name a few. It has been proven to work and liked by recruiters and hiring managers. |

## 🔍 Resume Parser

ResumeStudio's second component is the resume parser. For those who have an existing resume, the resume parser can help test and confirm its ATS readability.
